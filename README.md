My name is Felix Nesbigall, born in 1992 in Germany. I'm currently studying for my Master's Degree at Hochschule Worms - University of Applied Science.  
On top of that, I'm working for my Alma Mater as Laboratory Engineer for the Department of Computer Science, where I manage the Department's IT-Resources with my two colleagues and also teach a little networking to our undergraduates.
